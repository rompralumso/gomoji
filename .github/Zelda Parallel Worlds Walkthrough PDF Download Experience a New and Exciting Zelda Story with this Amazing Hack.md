## Step 1: Download the ROM and the Patch
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the original ROM of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (US version) and the patch file for Zelda Parallel Worlds. You can find them online by searching for them on Google or other search engines. Make sure you download the correct files and that they are virus-free.
 
The ROM file should have the name `Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (U) [!].smc` and the size of 1.024 KB. The patch file should have the name `Parallel Remodel v1-1.zip` and the size of 2.4 MB.
 
## Step 2: Apply the Patch
 
The next thing you need to do is to apply the patch file to the ROM file using a program called Lunar IPS. You can download it from [here](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/). Once you have downloaded and extracted Lunar IPS, run it and click on `Apply IPS Patch`. Then, select the patch file (`Parallel Remodel v1-1.zip`) and the ROM file (`Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (U) [!].smc`) in that order. The program will then create a new ROM file with the name `Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (U) [!].smc.PARALLEL REMODEL`. This is the ROM file that you will use to play Zelda Parallel Worlds.

## Step 3: Download an Emulator
 
An emulator is a program that allows you to play console games on your computer. There are many emulators available for different systems, but for this game, we recommend using Snes9x, which is one of the most popular and compatible SNES emulators. You can download it from [here](https://www.snes9x.com/). Once you have downloaded and extracted Snes9x, run it and click on `File > Load Game`. Then, select the ROM file that you created in step 2 (`Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (U) [!].smc.PARALLEL REMODEL`). The game should start running on your emulator.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the Game
 
You are now ready to enjoy Zelda Parallel Worlds. However, be warned that this game is not for the faint of heart. It is very hard and requires a lot of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat skills. You will also need to read carefully the hints and clues that are given throughout the game, as they will help you progress and avoid dead ends.
