In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the features and tweaks that Windows 7 Extreme Draconis Edition V3 X64 German 31 offers, and compare them with the original Windows 7. We will also discuss some of the potential risks and drawbacks of using this modified version of Windows 7.
 
## Features and Tweaks
 
Windows 7 Extreme Draconis Edition V3 X64 German 31 claims to improve the performance and stability of Windows 7 by optimizing the kernel. The kernel is the core component of the operating system that manages the communication between hardware and software. By tweaking some of the kernel settings, such as memory management, process scheduling, and power management, the developers of this version of Windows 7 aim to achieve faster and smoother operation.
 
However, these kernel optimizations may not be suitable for all types of hardware or software configurations. They may also cause unexpected errors or crashes, especially if they are not tested thoroughly. Moreover, these kernel optimizations may not be compatible with some of the updates or patches that Microsoft releases for Windows 7, which could lead to security or functionality issues.
 
Another feature that Windows 7 Extreme Draconis Edition V3 X64 German 31 boasts is its new design that resembles the upcoming Windows 8. It has a high contrast and angular appearance, with four themes (two basic and two aero themes) and the original themes. It also patches the UXTheme files to allow custom themes.

However, this design may not appeal to everyone's taste or preference. Some users may find it too harsh or dull, while others may prefer the original Windows 7 design. Moreover, this design may not be compatible with some of the applications or programs that are designed for Windows 7, which could result in graphical glitches or errors.
 
Windows 7 Extreme Draconis Edition V3 X64 German 31 also includes some tweaks that are supposed to enhance the user experience, such as disabling error reporting, prefetching, superfetching, program compatibility assistant, system restore, thumbnail caching, and more. These tweaks are intended to reduce the system overhead and improve the responsiveness of Windows 7.
 
However, these tweaks may also have some negative consequences for the user. For example, disabling error reporting may prevent the user from receiving useful feedback or solutions when something goes wrong with the system. Disabling prefetching and superfetching may slow down the loading of frequently used programs or files. Disabling program compatibility assistant may prevent the user from running some older or incompatible programs on Windows 7. Disabling system restore may prevent the user from restoring the system to a previous state in case of a problem. Disabling thumbnail caching may make it harder for the user to identify or preview files in folders.
 
## Risks and Drawbacks
 
As mentioned earlier, Windows 7 Extreme Draconis Edition V3 X64 German 31 is not an official release from Microsoft, and it may not be compatible with some hardware or software. It may also contain malware or viruses that could harm your computer or compromise your security. It is not recommended to use this version of Windows 7 for any serious or professional purposes, as it may not be stable or reliable. It may also violate the terms and conditions of Microsoft's license agreement, and expose you to legal risks.
 
One of the main risks of using this version of Windows 7 is that it may not receive any updates or patches from Microsoft. This means that it may not be protected from any new threats or vulnerabilities that are discovered in Windows 7. It may also not be compatible with any new features or improvements that Microsoft introduces for Windows 7. This could result in security or functionality issues for the user.
 
Another risk of using this version of Windows 7 is that it may contain malware or viruses that could harm your computer or compromise your security. These malware or viruses could be embedded in the installation files, in the system files, or in any of the programs or tools that are included in this version of Windows 7. They could steal your personal information, damage your files, monitor your activities, or take control of your computer.
 
A third risk of using this version of Windows 7 is that it may violate the terms and conditions of Microsoft's license agreement, and expose you to legal risks. Microsoft has a strict policy against modifying or distributing its software without its permission. By using this version of Windows 7, you may be infringing on Microsoft's intellectual property rights, and you may be liable for damages or penalties.
