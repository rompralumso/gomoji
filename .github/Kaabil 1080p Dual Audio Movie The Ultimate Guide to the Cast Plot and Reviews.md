For instance, did you know that Hrithik Roshan prepared for his role in Kaabil extensively? He locked himself in his house for four-five days to get into the skin of the character. He also moved around the house blindfolded so he could get himself acquainted with the body language of the blind people. He also invited a few blind people and keenly studied their mannerisms and expressions[^1^].
 
Another trivia is that Kaabil was also dubbed in Tamil and Telugu languages and released in China in 2019. The movie was well-received by the Chinese audience and earned over â¹32 crore in its first week[^3^]. The movie also features a recreated version of the classic song "Sara Zamana" from Yaarana which featured Amitabh Bachchan. Co-incidentally, it's a Rajesh Roshan song. Rajesh mentioned that back in the day, his nephew Hrithik (who is the lead actor in Kaabil) had helped him pick this tune for the 1982 number[^1^].
 
Kaabil is a movie that will make you feel proud of Hrithik Roshan and his team. It is a movie that will make you believe that nothing is impossible if you have faith in yourself. It is a movie that will make you Kaabil.
