The book is believed to be one of the oldest and most sacred texts in the world, dating back to millions of years ago. It is said to be written in a lost language called Senzar, which only a few initiates can decipher. The book is also said to be part of a larger collection of esoteric writings called the Akashic Records, which are stored in a hidden dimension beyond the physical plane.
 
The book was first introduced to the Western world by Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, who claimed to have access to the original manuscripts through her psychic abilities. She published some excerpts from the book in her magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine, in 1888. She also claimed that the book was the source of inspiration for many ancient religions and philosophies, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and Gnosticism.
 
However, the authenticity and existence of the book have been disputed by many scholars and critics, who argue that Blavatsky fabricated the book or plagiarized it from other sources. They also point out that there is no physical or historical evidence for the book or its alleged authors, who are supposed to be a group of enlightened beings called the Mahatmas or Masters of Wisdom.
 
Despite the controversy, the book has fascinated and influenced many seekers of spiritual knowledge and occult wisdom, who regard it as a valuable and hidden treasure. Cartea lui Dzyan PDF 13 is one of the many versions of the book that have been published online, offering a convenient and accessible way for anyone to read and study the book. The PDF file contains 13 chapters or stanzas, each with a commentary by Blavatsky or other Theosophical authors.

One of the most intriguing legends in Cartea lui Dzyan is about a mysterious civilization that existed in ancient India, known as the Valley of Indus or Harappa-Mohenjo-Daro. According to the book, this civilization was founded by a group of extraterrestrial visitors who came from Venus in a flying ship. They taught the natives advanced knowledge and skills, such as writing, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, architecture, engineering, art, and religion. They also built magnificent cities and monuments that were powered by a mysterious energy source.
 
However, this civilization was also doomed to fall, as some of the extraterrestrial visitors became corrupted and greedy. They started to exploit and oppress the natives, who rebelled against them. A great war broke out between the two factions, which resulted in a cataclysmic explosion that destroyed the entire civilization and left behind radioactive ruins. The book describes this event as similar to a nuclear blast, with fireballs, mushroom clouds, shockwaves, radiation sickness, and mutations. The survivors fled to other regions or went underground, while the extraterrestrial visitors returned to Venus or ascended to higher realms.
 
This legend has fascinated and puzzled many researchers and explorers who have tried to find evidence for its validity. Some have claimed to have found traces of ancient nuclear warfare in the Indus Valley sites, such as vitrified rocks, fused metals, skeletons with high radiation levels, and ancient texts that describe weapons of mass destruction. Others have dismissed these claims as pseudoscience or misinterpretation of natural phenomena. The debate is still ongoing among scholars and enthusiasts.
