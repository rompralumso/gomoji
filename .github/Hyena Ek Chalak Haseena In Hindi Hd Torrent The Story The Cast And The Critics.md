## Hyena Ek Chalak Haseena Movie Review
 
Hyena Ek Chalak Haseena is a comedy film directed by Dinesh Tiwari and produced by Lucky Morani. The film stars Lucky Morani as Haseena, a con woman who targets wealthy men and cheats them of their money. She is assisted by her friend Pinky (Zeenat Aman) and her lover Raju (Rajesh Puri). However, things get complicated when she falls in love with one of her victims, Ravi (Mukesh Tiwari), who is a police officer.
 
The film tries to be a funny and entertaining caper, but fails to deliver on both counts. The jokes are stale and forced, the plot is predictable and illogical, and the characters are shallow and annoying. The film also suffers from poor editing, cinematography, and direction. The only saving grace of the film is the music by Anand Raj Anand, which is catchy and melodious.
 
Hyena Ek Chalak Haseena is a disappointing and forgettable movie that wastes the talent of its cast and crew. We give it 1.5 stars out of 5.
